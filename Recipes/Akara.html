    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Akara is a very delicious dish made from blended beans,
        it is best served with bread but some prefer taking it with pap or garri.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing warms up a Saturday morning like a plateful of Akara 
        supported with a bowl of pap (popularly called "Akamu") or freshly 
        baked "Agege Bread".
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Red Ball Pepper (half of one red ball pepper)</li>
        <li>Chopped Onions (Optional)</li>
        <li>Crayfish (Optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans in room temperature water for
             about 15 to 20 minutes until the skin is swollen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the water and place the beans in the food processor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pulse the food processor a few times to remove the skin from the beans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the beans into a large bowl, add enough water, 
            and gently swirl the beans around so the skin can float. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat this process until the beans are clean.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the clean beans into a blender, add the water, red bell pepper, and crayfish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the batter into a large bowl and whisk it until it's light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the finely diced onion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat some oil (enough to fry the Akara) in a pan on medium to high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the batter in batches to avoid overcrowding.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flip once or twice to ensure even browningâ€”fry 
            the Akara for about five to six minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before removing any Akara from the oil, gently press them down to remove any excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the Akara from the pan and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
        </li>
